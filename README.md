#Motivation
This is a project for my Software Engineering class, about a website that helps online-multiplayer game players to connect to each other for a more pleasant experience.

#Code
This project was made in HTML, CSS, JQuery and Vanilla Javascript. I plan to expand it further to include a Node.JS, RESTful-based backend for a Full-Stack experience.
